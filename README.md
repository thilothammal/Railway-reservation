**1) Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  The code initializes a GUI window using Tkinter, a popular Python library for creating graphical interfaces.

**2)Input Fields:**
  It creates input fields for the user to enter specific details such as their name, the source station, the destination station, and the number of tickets they want to reserve.

**3) Reserve Ticket Function:**
  The reserve_ticket() function is triggered when the user clicks the "Reserve" button.
Inside this function, it retrieves the information entered by the user (name, source, destination, and number of tickets).

**4) Ticket Reservation Logic:**
  Placeholder logic is included within the reserve_ticket() function. It currently does not perform actual reservation or interaction with a database. Instead, it generates a confirmation message displaying the collected information.
  
**5) Confirmation Display:**
  The reservation confirmation details are displayed in a label (label_confirmation) on the GUI.
